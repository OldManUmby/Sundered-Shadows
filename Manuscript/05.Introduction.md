# Introduction

A tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG or RPG) is a collaborative storytelling pastime involving at least two players, though more players are typical. Together, the group plays through adventures in a fictional setting similar to a novel, TV series, or movie.

The *Rune9 Cinematic Adventure Ruleset* attempts to bring a standardized set of rules to the tabletop, which utilizes a cinematic gameplay style. The rules herein are lite and minimalistic, designed for storytelling and quick actions, yet allow for remarkable detail with many character options. By its very nature, this system is a non-tactical *theatre of the mind* game, meaning it runs a bit looser and faster, and although maps and miniatures can be utilized, most game aids are basic and kept to a minimum.

> ***Theatre of the Mind.*** This style of play is where everything in-game is wholly imagined and takes place in the players' minds. Here, the group can experience interactive adventures through the back-and-forth storytelling between the director and the players. Many groups rely on a mix of game aids, handouts, and maps, but at its core rests the detailed descriptions and visualizations of ‘theatre of the mind.’ Some consider this mind’s eye approach the quintessential gaming style.

> If adequately utilized, theatre of the mind allows gaming groups to concentrate more on the storylines, descriptions, and characterizations, visualizing and responding to everything in more detail and in less time, allowing for more productive game sessions. In addition, the director will spend less time preparing the tools of the trade for each adventure.

To summarize, one player acts as the game's director - known as a gamemaster in many RPGs - whose sole job is to create, manage, and narrate the adventures, including the behavior and dialogue of the supporting characters plus the schemes of the antagonists - the villain characters. All other players are responsible for the activities of the protagonists, the hero characters trying to survive and thrive in the adventures. However, the director and the players genuinely co-write the ongoing storylines from each play session.

> ***Actions of the Characters.*** Ultimately, the interpretations of the rules, the director's arbitrations, and a dice throw will determine the effectiveness of any in-game character actions - see `Action` for more information.

## Game Props

A few materials and tools are needed to utilize this ruleset; these items can be physical, digital, or a combination; however, always check with your director first, as there may be specific requirements for your game.

Typically, a game group will need a copy of the rules, note/graph paper, pencils, plenty of character record sheets - see `Appendix $$` for more information - and a set of gaming dice for each person. Also, more game materials are available for download at our official website; this includes various record forms, pre-generated characters, adventures, campaign materials, and supplements containing optional rules, new character `features`, and additional gear.

### Dice

This ruleset utilizes ten-sided dice (d10) to validate a character’s actions during gameplay; a handful of dice will be needed, as in 1d10, 2d10, 3d10, etc. Ideally, each player and the director should have their own dice set of at least 5d10; the more dice available, the smoother the play.

> ***D9 Die-Results.*** Although this ruleset uses 10-sided dice (d10), we interpret the outcome of a roll differently from other RPGs. When reading a die, there are no natural results of 10 (ten); here, we treat any roll of 0 (zero) as 0 (zero). So, the range of our d10 is 0 (zero) thru 9 (nine) only. However, due to modifiers, there may be cases when the final tallied results are greater than 9 (nine) - see `Modifiers` for more information.

## Conventions

These customary conventions are practiced throughout this ruleset.

***Specific Beats General.*** You may find aspects of the rules that break or contradict other elements. When this occurs, the director will arbitrate as needed; however, specific rules often beat general rules.

***Always Round Down.*** Unless specified in the rules, when you divide any number, you will always round down, no matter the final fraction.
