# Introduction

[Rune9](https://rune9.games)

A tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG or RPG) is a collaborative storytelling pastime involving at least two players, though more players are typical. Together, the group plays through adventures in a fictional setting similar to a novel, TV series, or movie.

The *Rune9 Cinematic Adventure Ruleset* attempts to bring a standardized set of rules to the tabletop, which utilizes a cinematic gameplay style. The rules herein are lite and minimalistic, designed for storytelling and quick actions, yet allow for remarkable detail with many character options. By its very nature, this system is a non-tactical *theatre of the mind* game, meaning it runs a bit looser and faster, and although maps and miniatures can be utilized, most game aids are basic and kept to a minimum.

> ***Theatre of the Mind.*** This style of play is where everything in-game is wholly imagined and takes place in the players' minds. Here, the group can experience interactive adventures through the back-and-forth storytelling between the gamemaster and the players. Many groups rely on a mix of game aids, handouts, and maps, but at its core rests the detailed descriptions and visualizations of ‘theatre of the mind.’ Some consider this mind’s eye approach the quintessential gaming style.

> If adequately utilized, theatre of the mind allows gaming groups to concentrate more on the storylines, descriptions, and characterizations, visualizing and responding to everything in more detail and in less time, allowing for more productive game sessions. In addition, the gamemaster will spend less time preparing the tools of the trade for each adventure.

As in most RPGs, the players are responsible for the actions of the protagonists - known as Player Characters (PCs). One player, however, acts as the director - known as the gamemaster (GM), creating, managing, and narrating everything during the adventures, including the plots, schemes, and actions of the antagonists - known as Non-Player Characters (NPCs). However, both the gamemaster and the players co-write the ongoing stories.

> ***Actions of the Characters.*** The dice throw, the rules interpretations, and the gamemaster's arbitrations will determine the effectiveness of any in-game actions. See `Action` for more information.

## Gameaids

A few materials and tools are needed to utilize this ruleset; these items can be physical, digital, or a combination; however, always check with your gamemaster first, as there may be specific requirements for your game.

Typically, a game group will need a copy of the rules, note paper, pencils, plenty of character record sheets - see `Appendix $$` for more information - and a set of gaming dice for each person. Also, there are more game aids available for download at our official website; this includes various record forms, pre-generated characters, adventures, campaign materials, and supplements containing optional rules, new character `features`, and additional gear.

### Dice

This ruleset utilizes ten-sided dice (d10) to validate a character’s actions during gameplay; a handful of dice will be needed. Ideally, each player and the gamemaster should have their own dice set; the more dice available, the smoother the play.

***D9 Die-Results.*** Although this ruleset uses 10-sided dice (d10), we interpret the outcome of a roll differently. When reading a die, there are no results of 10 (ten); here, we treat any roll of 0 (zero) as 0 (zero). So, the range of our d10 is 0 (zero) thru 9 (nine) only. However, due to modifiers, there may be cases when the final results are greater than 9 (nine); see `Modifiers` for more information.

## Conventions

These customary conventions are practiced throughout this ruleset.

***Specific Beats General.*** You may find aspects of the rules that break or contradict other elements. When this occurs, the gamemaster will arbitrate as needed; however, specific rules often beat general rules.

***Always Round Down.*** Unless specified in the rules, when you divide any number, you will always round down, no matter the final fraction.
