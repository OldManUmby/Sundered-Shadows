# ==BACK COVER==

<!--Add Back Cover design-->

Immerse yourself in a rich tapestry of the dark and fantastical, where ancient prophecies whisper through forgotten ruins, and secret things lurk in the shadows. Whether you seek to sunder evil, uncover hidden truths, or survive the unforgiving dangers of the night, *Sundered Shadows* offers a world ripe for exploration and adventure.

In *Sundered Shadows*, you are not bound by the constraints of the rules. Here, imagination knows no bounds, and your choices will shape your character's fate and the world they inhabit.

*Sundered Shadows* attempts to bring a minimalistic ruleset designed for storytelling and action flow yet allows for remarkable detail with many character features and equipment options. By its very nature, this ruleset is a classic non-tactical "theatre of the mind" game, meaning it runs a bit looser and faster than other number-crunching game systems. Although maps and miniatures can be utilized, most game aids are deliberately minimal.

*Sundered Shadows* is a roleplaying game of minimal rules using classical d20 mechanics. *Sundered Shadows* rests upon the concepts of better storytelling and heightened action with fewer rules and dice rolls.

**Features of Sundered Shadows:**

- Improved classical d20 mechanics
- Minimal ruleset for quick action rounds
- Heightened action economy
- Etc...
