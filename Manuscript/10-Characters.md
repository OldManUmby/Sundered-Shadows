### Generating Ability Scores

Except where noted in their lineage, all ancestries generate ability scores as follows. Roll 3d6 and tally the dice; repeat this process for each ability in order. The first three abilities list physical aspects - `a.k.a. Body` - while the final three represent mental aspects - `a.k.a. Mind`.

***Strength.*** Roll 3d6 once; tally the dice.
***Dexterity.*** Roll 3d6 once; tally the dice.
***Constitution.*** Roll 3d6 once; tally the dice.
***Intelligence.*** Roll 3d6 once; tally the dice.
***Wisdom.*** Roll 3d6 once; tally the dice.
***Charisma.*** Roll 3d6 once; tally the dice.
