### Generating Ability Scores

Except where noted in their lineage, all races generate ability scores as follows. Roll 3d6 and tally the dice; repeat this process for each ability in order. The first three abilities list the physical aspects - `a.k.a. Body` - while the final three represent the mental aspects - `a.k.a. Mind`.
