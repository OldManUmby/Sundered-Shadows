### Generating Ability Scores

Except where noted in their lineage, all races generate ability scores as follows. Roll 3d6 and tally the dice; repeat this process for each ability in order.

***Lawful.*** Characters believe in law, justice, order, and truth. Their word is their bond, and society comes before freedom and individuality.
***Neutral.*** Characters believe in the balance of law and chaos and, through their actions, will maintain that balance as best they can.
***Chaotic.*** Characters believe in anarchy, chaos, disorder, and freedom. They cannot be trusted, and freedom and individuality come before society.
