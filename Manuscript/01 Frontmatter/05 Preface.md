**For Even In The Light, There Are Always Shadows!**

Over the years, these games have evolved into the digital realm and are often not played around a tabletop, becoming less social and more tactical. This has led players down a rabbit hole of less role-playing, less interaction, and more virtual simulation, a complete degradation of the original experience.

We aim to change that!
