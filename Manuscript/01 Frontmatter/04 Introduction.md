# Introduction

A tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG or RPG) is not just a game; it's a shared journey of imagination and storytelling that fosters a strong sense of community. These games bring together a group of players, usually more than two, to embark on adventures in a fictional setting, much like a novel, TV series, or movie. It's a unique form of entertainment that allows you to immerse yourself in a story and create it with your fellow players, making every game a unique and memorable experience.

## What is Sundered Shadows?

*Sundered Shadows* (SSRPG) is an old-school renaissance (OSR) tabletop roleplaying game, a return to non-tactical, theatre-of-the-mind gameplay. It is a rules-lite, d20-based ruleset designed for storytelling, danger, and action flow, a derivative of many other OSR systems. *Sundered Shadows* plays fast and loose, and although maps and miniatures can be used, most game aids are kept minimal. However, unlike other OSR games, it still allows for a sundry of character features, optional and supplemental rules, and tons of gear. Sundered Shadows is highly customizable in many ways; easily add your own flavors and houserules.

> ***Theatre-of-the-Mind.*** This style of play is where everything in-game is wholly imagined, taking place in the players' minds, and is at the heart of *Sundered Shadows*. Here, the group can experience interactive adventures through the back-and-forth storytelling between the shadowmaster and the players. Many modern rulesets rely on tactical rules that get in the way, interfering with the game's flow. These games use plotted landscapes, or virtual tabletops (VTTs), that are excessively tactical; it's like playing a video game in slow motion. Theatre-of-the-mind is non-tactical and allows the shadowmaster and the players to describe actions in quick detail without worrying about the tactical rules. Although handouts, maps, and basic miniature placement can be used, theatre-of-the-mind allows gaming groups to concentrate more on the storylines, descriptions, and characterizations. This provides an opportunity to visualize and respond to everything in more detail and in less time, allowing for more productive and enjoyable game sessions. In addition, the shadowmaster will spend less time preparing the tools of the trade for each adventure. Many consider this mind’s eye approach the quintessential gaming style!

## How Do We Play The Game?

Players handle the actions of the protagonists - a.k.a. player characters (PC or PCs), the heroes trying to survive and thrive during the adventures. However, one player serves as the shadowmaster (SM), whose sole job is to create and manage the adventures, plus narrate the actions of the antagonists - a.k.a. non-player characters (NPC or NPCs) - including all beasts, bosses, and powers-that-be. Although it's the shadowmaster's job to create, arbitrate, narrate, and run the adventures, it's everyone's job to create an atmosphere of fun. Together, the shadowmaster and the players co-write the ongoing storyline from each person's or character's point of view. The storyline is continually generated - moment to moment - from the minds of the shadowmaster, the players, and the results of each dice roll.

>***Shadowmaster's Discretion.*** Simply put, the shadowmaster has the final say over ANY rule, decision, or situation. If the GM wishes to pass judgment, change, or houserule anything in the game - on the spot - that is within the GM's purview. However, it's always best to set expectations and discuss any homebrewed rule changes before playing; a session zero can be used this way. Nuff Said.
>***Player Safety.*** A shadowmaster is usually more experienced and wields all the power, which comes with great responsibility. However, newer players will face dangers and unique challenges to which they may not be accustomed or comfortable. Before starting, both the shadowmaster and the players should set any expectations they feel are essential. Always be tactful and respect others; pause the game when issues arise. Discuss what is happening and adjust things before proceeding with the game; a session zero can be used this way. Nuff Said.

## How Often Do We Play?

Adventures are governed and often created by the shadowmaster. Short adventures, referred to as one-shot or side quests, can take hours or days to play, spanning multiple sessions, while longer adventures can last for weeks or months. A traditional adventure is a self-contained quest with a single overall goal but can also be episodical, with many scenarios. Adventures can cover various locations, including countless worlds, planes, dimensions, and timelines, each setting offering unique challenges. Aside from being fun to play, adventures drive player character development; as you add experience to the character's record sheets, they become better at what they do.

Campaigns are a series of adventures usually connected by an overarching plot or hook that moves the player characters towards a goal, and often a final confrontation. Depending upon the players’ desires and the shadowmaster's plans, campaigns can be played for months or years, being paused and revisited many times. Campaigns could also be run and developed by multiple shadowmasters involving generations of characters.

## What Do We Need To Play?

A few supplies are needed to use this ruleset; these items can be physical, digital, or combined. Typically, a playgroup will draw maps, take notes, and track their character's stats; see `Appendix XX` for various game aids and sheets. Also, the playgroup will need gaming dice, ideally a set for each person.

### The Dice

This ruleset uses gaming dice to validate a character’s actions during gameplay. A handful of dice will be needed, typically consisting of a 4-sided die (d4), 6-sided die (d6), 8-sided die (d8), 10-sided die (d10), 12-sided die (d12), 20-sided die (d20), and percentile dice (d100) consisting of two 10-sided die (d10), or a single 10-sided die (d10) rolled twice.

> ***Dice Expressions and Pools.*** When multiples of the same die type are described in the text, called dice pools, the number of dice to roll will appear before the die type. For example, three 6-sided dice (d6) are written as *3d6*.
> ***Percentile Dice (d100).*** This die type comprises two 10-sided dice of different colors or styles. One die represents the "tens" position, and the other represents the "ones" position, designated which is which beforehand. Rolled together, the dice will generate a percentile number from 01% to 99%, and a roll of "00" (double zeros) on the dice equals 100%.

#### Advantage (ADV)

Per the shadowmaster, advantage (ADV) may be applied to any throw of the dice by adding an extra die to the roll and using the higher results; discard the low die.

#### Disadvantage (DIS)

Per the shadowmaster, disadvantage (DIS) may be applied to any throw of the dice by adding an extra die to the roll and using the lower results; discard the high die.

## Conventions

These customary conventions are practiced throughout the ruleset.

***Specific Beats General.*** You may find aspects of the rules that break or contradict other elements. When a contradiction occurs, specific rules often beat general rules; however, the shadowmaster will arbitrate as needed.

***Always Round Down.*** Unless specified in the rules, when you divide any number, you will always round down, no matter the fraction; a minimum of 1 always applies.

***Terminology.*** Terms have a specific usage and are defined throughout this ruleset. Where a term is used but not defined, browse the Index in the back of the material for its source. Popular terms often have a shortened form; the abbreviation will appear in parentheses where the term first appeared in the material.
