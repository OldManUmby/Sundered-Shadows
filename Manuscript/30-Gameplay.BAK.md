## Actions

Actions do not represent a solitary movement; rather, an action is a series of quick, combined movements, especially given the time involved during a character's turn. For example, casting a spell involves specific `vocal, somatic, and material components, plus a spell focus`, all working in unison. While attacking with a sword involves many quick feints, parries, thrusts, and short side-to-side movements before any actual harm can be done. This process cannot be duplicated in a tactical environment and is an important concept to remember when determining the game style and actions of a character.

<!--Also, for this reason, *Sundered Shadows* utilizes resource dice for tracking things like ammo and supplies in lots, rather than every individual piece of gear (see Resouce Dice for more information).-->

## Actions

Anytime a character is challenged, attempts something new, or the outcome of an action is in question, and a degree of success or failure must be ascertained, the gamemaster will request an action check. Next, the player rolls the appropriate dice, compares it against the difficulty, and calculates its performance. All other actions are considered routine or freebies and require no action check.

Standard actions include attacking, defending, maneuvering, spellcasting, and using `abilities, skills, and devices`.

### Non-Standard Actions

***Bonus.*** Momentum and extra actions gained under special circumstances.

<!--Add examples here -->

***Extended.*** Tasks requiring more than one action check to perform.

<!--Add examples here -->

***Group.*** An assisted action check performed by multiple characters. `Initiative is a group action.`

<!--Add examples here -->

***Save.*** A reaction involving a character's natural ability and experience.

## Action Check

*Roll 1d20 + proficiency +/- modifiers versus the Difficulty Class (DC).*

***Advantage.*** A character with an apparent situational advantage gains an extra d20 for the action check, of the two dice, the *highest* rolled die is used for the outcome; the *lower* rolled die is discarded. The `rules and the GM` will determine when an advantage exists.

***Disadvantage.*** A character with an apparent situational disadvantage gains an extra d20 for the action check, of the two dice, the *lowest* rolled die is used for the outcome; the *higher* rolled die is discarded. The `rules and the GM` will determine when a disadvantage exists.

***Success or Failure.*** If the roll reaches or exceeds the DC, the check is successful; otherwise, it fails. If successful, a performance rating is then calculated.

***Performance Rating.*** When an action succeeds, performance is calculated. Subtract the required DC of the action from the outcome of the rolled check; the difference is the action's Performance Rating (PR). `For example, a DC 15 action check versus a roll of 18 yields a PR 3 (18-15=3).` `Performance Rating is significant as it determines the finality of actions.`

## Difficulty Class

The gamemaster determines the Difficulty Class (DC) for all actions starting with the question, "Is the action opposed or unopposed?"

***Action is Opposed.*** Refers to actions that are in direct conflict with another character's action. For example, a character attacks while an opposed character defends, or a character hides while an opposed character searches.

*DC = The opponent's Armor Class (AC) or an opposed `Skill Check (SC)` rolled by the GM.*

***Action is Unopposed.*** Refers to actions that do not directly conflict with another character but rather the action's inherent difficulties. For example, a character is attempting to fix a broken wagon wheel or trying to lift a heavy object; there is no opposed character involved, just a level of difficulty.

*DC = The Difficulty is assigned by the GM starting with the Difficulting Class table below.*

:: Table: Difficulty Classes

| Difficulty | Easy | Moderate | Hard | Extreme |
| :--------: | :--: | :------: | :--: | :-----: |
|   **DC**   |  5   |    10    |  15  |   20+   |

## Check Modifiers

The Difficulty Class table is only a starting point; from here, the gamemaster adjusts the DC, `-5 thru +5`, based on any significant factors the GM determines are appropriate to the situation. Thus, the complete DC range is `0 thru 25`; a DC cannot be any lower or higher.

***Mundane Actions.*** Through modifiers, if an action reaches `DC 0`  or less, it is considered a mundane action for any character. The gamemaster will make the determination. In such cases, the GM may wave the action check entirely as an automatic success. However, the performance is considered PR 1; to improve the performance rating of a mundane action, a character may `Play the Odds`.

> ***Play the Odds.*** If a character (or the GM) still wishes to determine the performance of a mundane action, an action check can be made, but doing so returns the action to a *non-mundane* status of DC 2. Thus, if the check rolls a 1, a `Critical Failure` occurs due to some apparent oversight on the part of the character. Otherwise, the action's performance is calculated normally.

***Impossible Actions.*** An action of DC 25 or higher may be considered an impossible action for mortal characters. The gamemaster will make the determination. In such cases, the GM may wave the action check entirely as an automatic failure; no action check is allowed. However, an immortal character may still roll an impossible action check (see `Immortality` for more information).

### Initiative

When things get dicey, each character and opponent gets a turn. One player rolls 1d6 for their side versus a roll by the gamemaster. Each side modifies its die with the `lowest Combat Proficiency` of those entering initiative.

Participants may add their Dexterity bonuses in a one-on-one conflict, and reach weapons gain advantage on initiative rolls versus non-reach weapons.`

The side with the highest roll gets to declare their actions first and chooses the order of character actions as needed; this simulates the characters working together in combat.
