## Actions

Most character actions do not typically require dice rolls; these are considered routine actions or freebies. However, anytime a character is challenged, attempts something new, or the outcome of an action is in question, and a degree of success or failure must be ascertained, the gamemaster will request an action check.

Action checks are generally not considered solitary actions. More often, action checks are a series of short, quick maneuvers, combined actions, actions requiring extreme exertion, or complex tasks requiring a degree of concentration or planning.

### Action Types

***Standard.*** Action checks like attacking, defending, maneuvering, spellcasting, and using abilities, skills, and devices
***Bonus.*** Extra action checks gained for reasons of momentum or exceptional circumstances.
***Extended.*** Tasks requiring more than one action check to perform.
***Group.*** An assisted action check performed by multiple characters.
***Save.*** A reaction check involving a character's natural ability and experience.

### Defense/Difficulty Class (DC)

Defence Class (a.k.a. Defense) and Difficulty Class (a.k.a. Difficulty) are synonymous; both provide the required target number for all action checks. Determining DC, however, starts by asking, "Is the action opposed or unopposed?"

***Opposed Action Checks.*** Refers to actions that directly conflict with an opposing character's action, like a contest. For example, a character attacks while an opposed character defends; thus, the target number for the action check is provided by the defense class of the opponent. In another example, a character hides while an opposed character searches; thus, the target number for the action check is provided by an opposed action check rolled by the gamemaster; this would be more reminiscent of a difficulty class.

> DC = Defense Class or an opposed Action Check rolled by the gamemaster.

***Unopposed Action Checks.*** Refers to actions that do not directly conflict with another character but rather the action's inherent difficulties. For example, a character is attempting to fix a broken wagon wheel or lift a heavy object; no defense class or opposed action check is involved, simply a level of difficulty assigned by the gamemaster.

> DC = Difficulty Class assigned by the gamemaster.

:: Table: Difficulty Classes

| Difficulty | Easy | Moderate | Hard | Extreme |
| :--------: | :--: | :------: | :--: | :-----: |
|   **DC**   |  5   |    10    |  15  |   20+   |

### Action Check

*Roll 1d20 + Proficiency + Modifiers vs. DC*

***Advantage.*** A character with a situational advantage gains an extra d20 for the action check, of the two dice, the *highest* rolled die is used for the outcome; the *lower* rolled die is discarded. The rules and the GM will determine when an advantage exists.

***Disadvantage.*** A character with a situational disadvantage gains an extra d20 for the action check, of the two dice, the *lowest* rolled die is used for the outcome; the *higher* rolled die is discarded. The rules and the GM will determine when a disadvantage exists.

***Effectiveness.*** If the roll reaches or exceeds the DC, the check is effective; otherwise, it's ineffective. If effective, a performance rating is then calculated.

***Performance.*** Subtract the required DC of the action from the outcome of the rolled check; the difference is the action's Performance Rating (PR).

## Check Modifiers

The Difficulty Class table is only a starting point; from here, the gamemaster adjusts the DC, `-5 thru +5`, based on any significant factors the GM determines are appropriate to the situation. Thus, the complete DC range is `0 thru 25`; a DC cannot be any lower or higher.

***Mundane Actions.*** Through modifiers, if an action reaches `DC 0`  or less, it is considered a mundane action for any character. The gamemaster will make the determination. In such cases, the GM may wave the action check entirely as an automatic success. However, the performance is considered PR 1; to improve the performance rating of a mundane action, a character may `Play the Odds`.

> ***Play the Odds.*** If a character (or the GM) still wishes to determine the performance of a mundane action, an action check can be made, but doing so returns the action to a *non-mundane* status of DC 2. Thus, if the check rolls a 1, a `Critical Failure` occurs due to some apparent oversight on the part of the character. Otherwise, the action's performance is calculated normally.

***Impossible Actions.*** A DC 25 or higher action may be considered impossible for mortal characters. The gamemaster will make the determination. In such cases, the GM may wave the action check entirely as an automatic failure; no action check is allowed. However, an immortal character may still roll an impossible action check (see `Immortality` for more information).

### Initiative

When things get dicey, each character and opponent gets a turn. One player rolls 1d6 for their side versus a roll by the gamemaster. Each side modifies its die with the `lowest Combat Proficiency` of those entering initiative.

Participants may add their Dexterity bonuses in a one-on-one conflict, and reach weapons gain advantage on initiative rolls versus non-reach weapons.`

The side with the highest roll gets to declare their actions first and chooses the order of character actions as needed; this simulates the characters working together in combat.
