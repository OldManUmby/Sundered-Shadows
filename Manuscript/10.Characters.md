## Dwarf

The Dwarves are a race renowned for their unyielding workmanship and tenacious spirit that lives deep within the craggy mountains where the sounds of hammers and forges fill the air. These rugged underground dwellers have built out a long and illustrious existence that spans the pages of history.

Dwarves have a rich culture that they share among themselves that is replete with song, dancing, and humor despite being frequently perceived as severe and stern. Joyous laughing and the clinking of tankards may be heard resonating through the stone halls during big victory celebrations and festivals to honor their gods. However, they conceal a keen awareness of history and an unwavering resolve beneath their cheery demeanor. Dwarves have deep memories, and they rarely forget wrongs from the past. They remain unified against any threat that attempts to intrude upon their territories and are passionate defenders of their habitats.

Dwarves are built for resiliency with a capacity to survive the harshest conditions. They have broad shoulders and robust frames. Dwarves typically stand 4 to 5 feet tall yet still weigh as much as an average human.

### Clans and Kinship

Every element of their lives is infused with a strong sense of honor and responsibility, influencing how they act and make decisions. Dwarves are renowned for their strong work ethics, constant pursuit of perfection in their chosen professions and unshakable commitment to honoring their ancient traditions.

### Beyond the Mountains

Even though dwarves frequently inhabit underground areas, their influence goes beyond the boundaries of their mountain dwellings. Many dwarves travel to the outside world for adventure or to trade their exquisitely produced goods. Some even take up arms as fearsome warriors, utilizing their power, grit, and adept understanding of armor and weapons.

### Masters of the Forge

The Dwarves are unequaled artisans and master craftsmen known for their unrivaled abilities in mining and metallurgy.
