## Abilities

Every character possesses a unique set of innate abilities. The first trio embodies their physical prowess, while the latter trio encapsulates their mental acuity.

***Strength.*** Brawn, might, and physical power.
***Dexterity.*** Coordination, reflexes, and speed.
***Constitution.*** Health, stamina, and toughness.
***Intelligence.*** Judgment, reasoning, and savvy.
***Wisdom.*** Awareness, focus, and instincts.
***Charisma.*** Influence, nerve, and presence.

### Ability Modifiers

The normal range for characters is between 3 and 18. Sometimes, a score could drop below 3 or rise above 18. If a score drops to 0 (zero), the character becomes incapacitated until the score rises to 1 or more; see `Incapacitation` for more information. A score of 20 is the highest possible score for a mortal character. Should a score rise above 20 permanently, the character becomes renowned; see `Renowned` for more information.

### Generating Ability Scores

All races generate their ability scores the same way. Roll 3d6 and tally the dice; repeat this process for each ability in order. As noted under each lineage and class, prime requisites have advantage. After all ability scores are rolled, the player may swap any two scores. Prime requisites may only be swapped with a higher score.

### Alignment

***Lawful.*** Characters believe in law, justice, order, and truth. Their word is their bond, and society comes before the needs of the individual.

***Neutral.*** Characters believe in the balance of law and chaos and, through their actions or inactions, will maintain that balance as best they can.

***Chaotic.*** Characters believe in anarchy, chaos, disorder, and freedom. They cannot be trusted, and individuality comes before the needs of society.
