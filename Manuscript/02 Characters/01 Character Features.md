### Ability Modifiers

The normal range for ability scores is between 3 and 18. Sometimes, a score could drop below 3 or rise above 18. If a score drops to 0 (zero), the character becomes incapacitated until the score rises to 1 or more; see `Incapacitation` for more information. A score of 20 is the highest possible score for a mortal character. Should a score rise above 20 (permanently), the character becomes renowned; see `Renowned` for more information. `Renowned is the first step to becoming immortal; see Immortality for more information.`

### Generating Ability Scores

All races generate their ability scores the same way. Roll 3d6 and tally the dice; repeat this process for each ability in order. As noted under each lineage and class, prime requisites have advantage when rolling for ability scores. Once all scores are rolled, the player may swap any two. Prime requisites may only be swapped to gain a higher score.

### Aging

When creating a character, or as a character advances in years, apply any adjustment below.

***Child.*** <!--add copy here-->
***Young.*** <!--add copy here-->
***Adult.*** <!--add copy here-->
***Old.*** <!--add copy here; master a skillset-->
***Venerable.*** <!--add copy here-->
***Ancient.*** <!--add copy here-->

***Unnatural Aging.*** Characters and creatures rapidly aged or made young again by magic or effect are not impacted by crossing any age categories but are closer to natural death or have prolonged it.

***Immortality***. Characters who become immortal do not continue to age past adulthood unless they have already aged past that point; from there, all physical aging stops. They receive no penalties as they proceed through the years, only the bonuses. `In addition, for each "lifetime" spent as an immortal, they may master any one skillset or swap out any one skillset for a new one, assuming they have worked towards that goal.`

## Alignment

***Lawful.*** Characters believe in law, justice, order, and truth. Their word is their bond, and society comes before the needs of the individual.

***Neutral.*** Characters believe in the balance of law and chaos and, through their actions or inactions, will maintain that balance as best they can.

***Chaotic.*** Characters believe in anarchy, chaos, disorder, and freedom. They cannot be trusted, and individuality comes before the needs of society.

## Corruption (Optional)
