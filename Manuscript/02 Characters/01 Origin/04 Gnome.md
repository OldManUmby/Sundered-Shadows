Gnomes are a race renowned for their vibrant personalities, secretive nature, and strong connection to the fey. Known for their wild and unpredictable behavior, gnomes are highly magical beings with a natural affinity for illusions and tinkering with new magical inventions. Their playful and curious demeanor often masks their deep wisdom and profound understanding of the arcane. Gnomes prefer to live in deep burrows, creating intricate underground homes filled with wonder and mystery.

## Vibrant and Secretive

Gnomes are characterized by their bright, colorful appearances and lively personalities. They are smaller than most other races, standing between 3 to 4 feet tall, with an energetic and sprightly demeanor. Their hair and eyes come in a variety of vivid colors, often reflecting their magical nature, ranging from electric blue to deep purple. Gnomes are naturally secretive, preferring to hide their homes and lives from outsiders. This secrecy is not born out of distrust but rather a desire to protect their way of life and the magical secrets they hold dear. Their unpredictable behavior and love for surprises make them both intriguing and enigmatic to other races.

## Bands and Bonds

Gnome society is built around small, close-knit bands that live together in elaborate underground burrows. These communities are characterized by strong familial bonds and a deep sense of loyalty and trust. Gnomes value friendship and family above all else, often forming lifelong bonds with their kin and close friends. Their burrows blend practicality and whimsy, featuring hidden passages, secret rooms, and intricate designs that reflect their playful nature.

## Beyond the Burrows
