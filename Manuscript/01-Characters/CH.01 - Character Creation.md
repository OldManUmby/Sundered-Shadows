# CHARACTER CREATION

This section contains rules for generating a player character (PC). Follow the steps below. Record your character's stats, information, and gear on the provided character sheet; see Appendix XX: Character Sheet.

5. Generate coinage and select starting gear.
6. Calculate defense class and hit points.

## Abilities

All characters have a set of natural abilities. The first three abilities define the physical aspects, while the final three represent the mental aspects.

***Strength.*** Brawn, might, and physical power.
***Dexterity.*** Coordination, reflexes, and speed.
***Constitution.*** Resilience, vitality, and stamina.
***Intelligence.*** Learning, judgment, and reasoning.
***Wisdom.*** Instinct, perception, and willpower.
***Charisma.*** Charm, influence, and presence.

### Ability Modifiers

The normal range for characters is between 3 and 18. There are times when a score could drop below 3 or rise above 18. Should a score drop to 0 (zero), the character becomes incapacitated until the score rises to 1 or more; for more information, see [[Incapacitation]]. A score of 20 is the highest possible score for a mortal character. Should a score rise above 20 permanently, the character becomes renowned; for more information, see [[Renowned]].

### Generating Ability Scores

All races generate their ability scores the same way. Roll 3d6 and tally the dice; repeat this process for each ability in order. As noted under each lineage and class, prime requisites have advantage. After all ability scores are rolled, the player may swap any two scores. Prime requisites may only be swapped with a higher score.

### Age

All characters and creatures use the following age categories throughout the ruleset.

***Child.*** <!--add copy here-->
***Young.*** <!--add copy here-->
***Adult.*** <!--add copy here-->
***Old.*** <!--add copy here-->
***Venerable.*** <!--add copy here-->
***Ancient.*** <!--add copy here-->

### Alignment

***Lawful.*** Characters believe in law, justice, order, and truth. Their word is their bond, and society comes before freedom and individuality.

***Neutral.*** Characters believe in the balance of law and chaos and, through their actions or inactions, will maintain that balance as best they can.

***Chaotic.*** Characters believe in anarchy, chaos, disorder, and freedom. They cannot be trusted, and freedom and individuality come before society.
