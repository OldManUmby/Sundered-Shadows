### Generating Ability Scores

All races generate their ability scores the same. Roll 3d6 and tally the dice; repeat this process for each ability in order. As noted under each lineage and class, prime requisites have advantage. After all ability scores are rolled, the player may swap any two scores once. Prime requisites may only be swapped with a higher score.
