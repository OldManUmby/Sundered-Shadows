## Action Check

To check an action, roll 1d20, then add the appropriate ability rating, proficiency, and any modifiers. Then, compare the roll against the difficulty class.

> **1d20 + Ability + Proficiency + Modifiers vs. DC.**

***Advantage.*** A character with a situational advantage gains an extra d20 for the action check; of the two dice, the *highest* die rolled is used for the outcome; the *lower* die rolled is discarded. The `rules and the GM` will determine when an advantage exists.

***Disadvantage.*** A character with a situational disadvantage gains an extra d20 for the action check; of the two dice, the *lowest* die rolled is used for the outcome; the *higher* die rolled is discarded. The `rules and the GM` will determine when a disadvantage exists.

***Success or Failure.*** If the roll reaches or exceeds the DC, the check is successful; otherwise, it fails. If successful, effectiveness is then calculated.

***Effectiveness.*** When an action succeeds, subtract the required DC of the action check from the roll's outcome; the difference is the effectiveness of the action.

> ** Roll - DC = Effectiveness.**

## Defense/Difficulty Class

DC refers to either Defense Class or Difficulty Class; they are synonymous and represent a target number needed to perform an action.

***Defense Class.*** A target number representing the capacity to defend against opposed combat actions. An opposed action refers to an action that is in direct opposition to another character's action. For example, a character attacks while an opposed character defends -or- a character hides while an opposed character searches.

***Difficulty Class.*** A target number representing the level of difficulty in performing unopposed non-combat actions.

The gamemaster determines the DC for all actions starting with the question, "Is the action opposed or unopposed?"

***Action is Opposed.*** Refers to an action that is in direct opposition to another character's action. For example, a character attacks while an opposed character defends -or- a character hides while an opposed character searches.

*DC = The opposition's `Defense` or opposed Action Check rolled by the GM.*

***Action is Unopposed.*** Refers to actions that do not directly conflict with another character but rather the action's inherent difficulties. For example, a character is attempting to fix a broken wagon wheel or trying to lift a heavy object; there is no opposed character involved, just a level of difficulty.

*DC = The Difficulty is assigned by the GM starting with the Difficulting Class table below.*

:: Table: Difficulty Classes

| Difficulty | Easy | Moderate | Hard | Extreme |
| :--------: | :--: | :------: | :--: | :-----: |
|   **DC**   |  5   |    10    |  15  |   20+   |

## Action Modifiers

***DC Modifiers.*** The Difficulty Class table is only a starting point; from here, the gamemaster adjusts the DC, `-5 thru +5`, based on any significant factors the GM determines are appropriate to the situation. Thus, the complete DC range is `0 thru 25`; a DC cannot be any lower or higher.

***Mundane Actions.*** Through modifiers, if an action reaches `DC 0`  (or less), it is considered a mundane action for any character. The gamemaster will make the determination. In such cases, the GM may wave the action check entirely as an automatic success. However, the performance is considered PR 1; to improve the performance rating of a mundane action, a character may `Play the Odds`.

> ***Play the Odds.*** If a character (or the GM) still wishes to determine the performance of a mundane action, an action check can be made, but doing so returns the action to a *non-mundane* status of DC 2. Thus, if the check rolls a 1, a `Critical Failure` occurs due to some apparent oversight on the part of the character. Otherwise, the action's performance is calculated normally.

***Impossible Actions.*** A DC 25 or higher action may be considered impossible for mortal characters. The gamemaster will make the determination. In such cases, the GM may wave the action check entirely as an automatic failure; no action check is allowed. However, an immortal character may still roll an impossible action check (see `Immortality` for more information).

### Initiative

When things get dicey, each character and opponent gets a turn. One player rolls 1d6 for their side versus a roll by the gamemaster. Each side modifies its die with the `lowest Combat Proficiency` of those entering initiative.

Participants may add their Dexterity bonuses in a one-on-one conflict, and reach weapons gain advantage on initiative rolls versus non-reach weapons.`

The side with the highest roll gets to declare their actions first and chooses the order of character actions as needed; this simulates the characters working together in combat.
