# ==INTRODUCTION==

A tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG or RPG) is a collaborative storytelling pastime involving a playgroup of at least two players, though more players are typical. Together, this group plays through adventures in a fictional setting similar to a novel, TV series, or movie.

## Who Plays What?

The players are responsible for the actions of the protagonist - a.k.a. player characters (PCs), the heroes trying to survive and thrive during the adventures. However, one of the players serves as the gamemaster (GM), whose sole job is to create and manage the adventures, plus narrate the actions of the protagonists - a.k.a. non-player characters (NPCs). All animals and monsters are also forms of NPCs.

Although it's the gamemaster's job to create the adventures, it's everyone's job to create an atmosphere of fun. Together, the gamemaster and the players genuinely co-write the ongoing storyline from each person's - or character's - point of view.

### Expectations

One of the most important aspects of *Sundered Shadows* is that the gamemaster has the final say over any adventure, campaign, or gameplay decisions and all the rules of this system. If the GM wishes to change or houserule anything in the game, then that is within the GM's purview. However, it's always best to set expectations and rule changes before playing; a good session zero can be utilized in this way.

## What is Sundered Shadows?

*Sundered Shadows* (SSRPG) is a rules-lite d20-based old-school renaissance (OSR) roleplaying game designed for storytelling, danger, and action flow and yet allows for a sundry of character features, gear, and optional rules. *Sundered Shadows* is a non-tactical "theatre of the mind" game, meaning it runs fast and loose, and although maps and miniatures can be utilized, most game aids are minimal.

>  ***Theatre of the Mind.*** This style of play is where everything in-game is wholly imagined and takes place in the players' minds. Here, the group can experience interactive adventures through the back-and-forth storytelling between the gamemaster and the players. Many groups rely on a mix of game aids, handouts, and maps, but at its core rests the detailed descriptions and visualizations of ‘theatre of the mind.’ Some consider this mind’s eye approach the quintessential gaming style.

> If adequately utilized, theatre of the mind allows gaming groups to concentrate more on the storylines, descriptions, and characterizations, visualizing and responding to everything in more detail and less time, allowing for more productive and enjoyable game sessions. In addition, the gamemaster will spend less time preparing the tools of the trade for each adventure.

## What do I need to play?

A few supplies are needed to utilize this ruleset; these items can be physical, digital, or combined. Typically, a playgroup will draw maps, take notes, and track their character's stats. See `Appendix $$` for various game aids and sheets. Also, the playgroup will need a set of gaming dice, preferably a set for each person.

### The Dice

This ruleset utilizes gaming dice to validate a character’s actions during gameplay; a handful of dice will be needed, as in a 4-sided die (d4), 6-sided die (d6), 8-sided die (d8), 12-sided die (d12), and 20-sided die (d20); a pair of 10-sided die (d10) will also be required. Utilizing the d10 pair, one can also roll a d100 (a.k.a. percentile dice). Ideally, each player and the gamemaster should have a complete set of dice, though you could use less; however, the more dice available, the smoother the play.

> ***Dice Expressions.*** When multiples of the same die type are described in the text, the number of dice to roll will appear before the die type. For example, two 6-sided dice (d6) are written as *2d6*. Other dice expressions include Advantage and Disadvantage; see `Gameplay` for more information.
>
> ***Percentile Dice (d100).*** This die type consists of two 10-sided dice, where one die represents the "tens" position, and the other represents the "ones" position. Rolled together, the dice will generate a percentile number from 01% to 99%, and a roll of 100% is seen as "00" (double zeros) on the dice.

## Conventions

These customary conventions are practiced throughout this ruleset.

***Specific Beats General.*** You may find aspects of the rules that break or contradict other elements. When a contradiction occurs, specific rules often beat general rules; however, the gamemaster will arbitrate as needed.

***Always Round Down.*** Unless specified in the rules, when you divide any number, you will always round down, no matter the fraction.
