# ==INTRODUCTION==

A tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG or RPG) is a collaborative storytelling pastime involving a playgroup of at least two players, though more players are typical. Together, this group plays through adventures in a fictional setting similar to a novel, TV series, or movie.

## What is Sundered Shadows?

*Sundered Shadows* (SSRPG) is a return to non-tactical, theatre-of-the-mind gameplay. *Sundered Shadows* is a rules-lite, d20-based system designed for storytelling, danger, and action flow, and yet allows for a sundry of character features, gear, and supplemental rules. *Sundered Shadows* runs fast and loose, and although maps and miniatures can be utilized, most game aids are minimal.

> ***Theatre-of-the-Mind.*** This style of play is where everything in-game is wholly imagined, taking place in the players' minds, and is at the heart of Sundered Shadows. Here, the group can experience interactive adventures through the back-and-forth storytelling between the gamemaster and the players. Many modern rulesets rely on tactical rules that simply get in the way and interfere with the moment's creativity. These games utilize a tactical landscape that is too restrictive, it's like watching a turn-by-turn video game in slow motion, and it gets worse under the guise of virtual tabletops (VTTs). Theatre-of-the-mind is non-tactical and allows players and gamemasters to describe actions in quick cinematic detail without worrying about the tactical rules.

> Although handouts and maps can be utilized, this methodology allows gaming groups to concentrate more on the storylines, descriptions, and characterizations. This provides an opportunity to visualize and respond to everything in more detail and in less time, allowing for more productive and enjoyable game sessions. In addition, the gamemaster will spend less time preparing the tools of the trade for each adventure. Many consider this mind’s eye approach the quintessential gaming style!

## Who Plays What?

The players are responsible for the actions of the protagonists - a.k.a. player characters (PCs), the heroes trying to survive and thrive during the adventures. However, one of the players serves as the gamemaster (GM), whose sole job is to create and manage the adventures, plus narrate the actions of the antagonists - a.k.a. non-player characters (NPCs) - including all animals, monsters, and powers-that-be. Although it's the gamemaster's job to create the adventures, it's everyone's job to create an atmosphere of fun. Together, the gamemaster and the players genuinely co-write the ongoing storyline from each person's - or character's - point of view.

### Expectations

One of the most critical aspects of *Sundered Shadows* is that the gamemaster arbitrates everything and has the final say over any rule, decision, or situation. If the GM wishes to pass judgment, change, or houserule anything in the game, that is within the GM's purview. However, it's always best to set expectations and any rule changes before playing; a good session zero can be utilized this way.

## What do I need to play?

A few supplies are needed to utilize this ruleset; these items can be physical, digital, or combined. Typically, a playgroup will draw maps, take notes, and track their character's stats; see `Appendix $$` for various game aids and sheets. Also, the playgroup will need a set of gaming dice, preferably for each person.

### The Dice

This ruleset utilizes gaming dice to validate a character’s actions during gameplay; a handful of dice will be needed, as in a 4-sided die (d4), 6-sided die (d6), 8-sided die (d8), 12-sided die (d12), and 20-sided die (d20); a pair of 10-sided die (d10) will also be required. Utilizing the d10 pair, one can also roll a d100 (a.k.a. percentile dice). Ideally, each player and the gamemaster should have a complete set of dice, though you could use less; however, the more dice available, the smoother the play.

> ***Dice Expressions.*** When multiples of the same die type are described in the text, the number of dice to roll will appear before the die type. For example, two 6-sided dice (d6) are written as *2d6*. Other dice expressions include Advantage and Disadvantage; see `Gameplay` for more information.
>
> ***Percentile Dice (d100).*** This die type consists of two 10-sided dice, where one die represents the "tens" position, and the other represents the "ones" position. Rolled together, the dice will generate a percentile number from 01% to 99%, and a roll of 100% is seen as "00" (double zeros) on the dice.

## Conventions

These customary conventions are practiced throughout this ruleset.

***Specific Beats General.*** You may find aspects of the rules that break or contradict other elements. When a contradiction occurs, specific rules often beat general rules; however, the gamemaster will arbitrate as needed.

***Always Round Down.*** Unless specified in the rules, when you divide any number, you will always round down, no matter the fraction.

## Jargon

***Natural 1.*** During a check, when the d20 rolls an unmodified 1, the effectiveness is considered a critical failure.

***Natural 20.*** During a check, when the d20 rolls an unmodified 20, the effectiveness is considered a critical success.

***Play the Odds.*** Within this ruleset, there are several points where a static value is used to speed gameplay; `this value will be highlighted within the rules`. If a character wishes to make a dice roll in place of the static value, they may do so, but not without risk. All static values are calculated at 60% of the total possible range. Should a player choose to play the odds, they only have a 40% of attaining a higher value; the gamemaster should always point out this fact before the player proceeds. Should the player proceed and they roll a lower number than the provided static value, they must accept the new value rolled. <!--Can a player circumvent this with Inspiration?-->
