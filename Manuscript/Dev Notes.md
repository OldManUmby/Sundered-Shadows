## Time

Time within the game is divided into segments, each with its usage. A segment's duration is approximate and non-tactical; no exact measurements exist. The gamemaster determines each segment according to the situation and the character's actions. However, most actions live in the moment, and only a few extend into other segments. A moment is fleeting, lasting seconds, while an interval lasts minutes. A period lasts hours, while downtime can last days or longer.

:: Table | Time Segements

|  Segment | Approx. Duration | Common Usage                                     |
| -------: | :--------------: | ------------------------------------------------ |
|   Moment |   1-10 Seconds   | `Most action checks`                             |
| Interval |   1-10 Minutes   | `Exploration, rests, and tasks`                  |
|   Period |    1-10 Hours    | `Recovery, research, travel, and tasks`          |
| Downtime |    1-10 days     | `All under period, plus recreation and training` |

## Ranges

Ranges, or zones, are measured in areas. An area is approximate and non-tactical; no exact measurements exist. The gamemaster determines the size of each zone according to the number of areas involved, the situation, and the character's actions.

Everything in reach or a few steps away is within 1 area, called the immediate area; this is close range. Most actions are performed in the immediate area, with only a few extending into other zones. Everything up and through 3 areas away is near range, called nearby or the surrounding area. Beyond 4 areas is far range and covers everything within sight and in focus, where details can still be distinguished, perhaps out to 6 areas. Still within sight but out of focus lies distant range, approximately 7+ areas away. Remote areas are further still, beyond the sight of a character. `Self is technically not a range but is included here for obvious reasons.`

:: Table | Range Zones

|    Zone | Approx. Distance | Common Usage                                                |
| ------: | :--------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Self |     Oneself      | `Healing and spells that affect self, shooting point-blank` |
|   Close |  Within 1 area   | `Movement + fight and shooting close`                       |
|    Near |  2-3 areas away  | `Movement + fight, throwing, and shooting near`             |
|     Far |  4-6 areas away  | `Full movement and shooting far`                            |
| Distant |  7+ areas away   | `Shooting distant`                                          |
|  Remote |   Beyond sight   | `Omnipresent magic`                                         |

## Actions

Most actions are standard, like attacking, defending, maneuvering, spellcasting, and using `attributes, skills, and devices.` However, several types of actions fall into particular categories.

**Bonus** | Actions gained for reasons of momentum or special circumstances.
**Extended** | Actions requiring more than one check and several segments to complete.
**Instant** | Actions that occur in the here and now before other standard actions.
**Group** | An assisted action performed by multiple characters.
**Save** | A reaction involving a character's natural ability and experience.

An action check is generally not considered solitary. There are exceptions, like extended or group actions, but most often, an action check is a series of short, quick actions performed under stress, in desperation, requiring extreme exertion, or a complex undertaking where a degree of concentration is needed. In these instances, actions are bound by a single action check.

### Target Number

For a character to make an action check, the action's [TN] Target Number must be ascertained using an associated attribute. For most actions, the appropriate attribute will be obvious based on the provided definitions but requires arbitration from the gamemaster. The attribute will function as the base target number for the action check. Next, the gamemaster will subtract the foe's `[DEF] Defense`; the lower the target number, the more difficult the action check.

> `Target Number (TN) = Attribute - Defence Class (DC).`


### Action Check

Typically, most character actions do not require dice rolls; these are non-combat actions considered mundane. However, anytime a character attacks, defends, attempts something new or challenging, casts a spell, or the outcome of an action is in question, and a degree of success or failure must be ascertained, the gamemaster will request an action check.

To make an action check, roll 1d20 and compare the result against the final TN.

**Success** | If the roll is lower than the TN, the character succeeds.
**Critical Success** | If the roll is a 1, then the character succeeds critically.

**Failure** | If the roll reaches or is higher than the TN, the character fails.
**Critical Failure** | If the roll is a 20, then the character fails critically.

## Combat

### Initiative

Most actions occur at the moment, and since all actions are simultaneous, there are no "turns." Still, each character gets their moment in the spotlight. This process is achieved through a special check called Initiative, determining who acts before the foes.

#### Initiative Check

Each player-character rolls either a DEX or WIS Check, whichever attribute is higher or more appropriate to the situation; the gamemaster will make this determination. A situation that leans heavily on reaction time would rely on Dexterity, but if common sense, instinct, or perception is key to first discerning the situation, then it makes more sense to use Wisdom. Each character that succeeds on the check may act before the foes; all other PCs will act after the foes.

**Critical Success** |  The character gains a bonus action at the moment.

**Critical Failure** |  The character may only take a standard action -OR- a move action at the moment, but not both.
