# ==GAMEPLAY==

When things get dicey, each character and opponent gets a turn. One player rolls 1d6 for their side versus a roll by the gamemaster. Each side modifies its die with the lowest proficiency bonus from its group. The side with the highest roll gets to act first and chooses the order of their actions as needed.

`The participants in a one-on-one conflict may also add their Dexterity bonus. Reach weapons gain advantage on initiative versus non-reach weapon users.`

### Action Check

Anytime a character is challenged, attempts something new or demanding, or the outcome is in question, and a degree of success or failure must be ascertained, the gamemaster will request an Action Check.

Roll 1d20 + proficiency + any appropriate modifiers. This roll is then compared against a Difficulty Class (DC) assigned by the Gamemaster. If the roll reaches or exceeds the DC, the check is successful, else it fails.
