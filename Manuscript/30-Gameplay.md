### Action Check

When a character is challenged, attempts something new or difficult, or the outcome is in question, and a degree of success or failure must be ascertained, then the gamemaster will request an Action Check. Roll 1d20 + ability modifier + proficiency. This roll is then compared against the Difficulty Class (DC). If the roll reaches or exceeds the DC, the check is successful, else it fails.
