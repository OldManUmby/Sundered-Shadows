## Segments of Time

Time is divided into the following segments.

|  Segment | Approx. Duration | Common Usages                            |
| -------: | :--------------: | ---------------------------------------- |
|   Moment |   1-10 Seconds   | `EARLY, NOW and LATE Action Checks`      |
| Interval |   1-10 Minutes   | `Exploration, Resting, and Tasks`        |
|   Period |    1-10 Hours    | `Recovery, Studying, Travel, and Tasks`  |
| Downtime |    1-10 days     | `Recreation, Training, Travel and Tasks` |

## Actions in the Moment

All actions occur in the moment, and since all actions are simultaneous, there are no "turns." Still, each character gets their moment in the spotlight.

### All At Once

1. Players declare their actions and order, while the gamemaster does the same.

2. Action Checks are rolled.

3. Effectiveness and Performance are resolved.

However, some actions do resolve at slightly different moments. So, when things get dicey, and the order of things must be determined, the action type takes precedence.

**"EARLY" in the Moment** | Quick, Ranged, Reach, and Surprise actions resolve EARLY, before all other actions. A Readied action from the previous Moment resolves EARLY or can become a Delayed action resolving NOW or LATE.

**In the Moment** | Most standard actions resolve at the moment. If desired, a Delayed action resolves NOW. A Charge action begins NOW but resolves LATE. Readying an action NOW resolves EARLY in the next Moment.

**"LATE" in the Moment** | Bonus, Slow, and Charge actions resolve LATE. A Delayed action that traverses beyond LATE automatically becomes a Readied action Early the next Moment.

**In any Moment** | When triggered, Delayed actions and Reactions resolve immediately in any moment or segment. `Saving throws are an example of a reaction.`

## Range

Range is divided into the following zones.

|    Zone |      Approx. Distance      |
| ------: | :------------------------: |
|    Self |            Self            |
|   Reach |        Within reach        |
|   Close |     Just beyond reach      |
|    Near |      Surrounding area      |
|     Far | Within sight; within focus |
| Distant | Within sight; out of focus |
|  Remote |        Beyond Sight        |

## Actions

Typically, most character actions do not require dice rolls; these are non-combat actions considered mundane. However, anytime a character is challenged, attacks, attempts something new, `performs a feat`, casts a spell, or the outcome of an action is in question, and a degree of success or failure must be ascertained, the gamemaster will request an action check.

An action check is generally not considered a solitary action. There are exceptions, but most often, an action check is a series of short, quick attacks and maneuvers, an action performed under stress or requiring extreme exertion, or a complex undertaking where a degree of concentration is needed, all under a single action check by a character.

### Action Types

**Standard** | Actions requiring action checks like attacking, defending, maneuvering, spellcasting, and using `abilities, skills, and devices`. Standard actions are typically resolved NOW.
**Bonus** | Extra action checks gained for reasons of momentum or special circumstances. Bonus actions are resolved LATE.
**Extended** | Tasks requiring more than one standard or group action to perform. Tasks often require several moments, intervals, or periods to complete; anything beyond that requires downtime, per the gamemaster.
**Group** | Standard action checks performed by multiple characters. These assisted actions are typically resolved NOW `but may also fall under the purview of tasks`.
**Save** | A reaction check involving a character's natural ability and experience. Reactions are resolved in any moment or segment.

#### Who Acts First?

### Action Checks

> Roll 1d20 + Proficiency + Modifiers.

***Advantage (ADV).*** A character with a situational advantage gains an extra d20 for the action check, of the two dice, the *highest* rolled die is used for the outcome; the *lower* rolled die is discarded. The rules and the GM will determine when an advantage exists.

***Disadvantage (DIS).*** A character with a situational disadvantage gains an extra d20 for the action check, of the two dice, the *lowest* rolled die is used for the outcome; the *higher* rolled die is discarded. The rules and the GM will determine when a disadvantage exists.

***Effectiveness (EFF).*** If the roll reaches or exceeds the DC, the check is successful; otherwise, it has failed. If successful, performance is calculated.

***Performance (PER).*** Subtract the required DC of the action from the outcome of the rolled check; the difference is the action's performance.

#### Defense/Difficulty Class (DC)

Defence Class (a.k.a. Defense) and Difficulty Class (a.k.a. Difficulty) are synonymous; both provide the required target number for all action checks. The gamemaster has three methods for determining DC.

***Attacks.*** Used for attacks where an opposition can defend. An opponent's defense class provides the target number for the attack action.

> DC = The Defense Class of an opponent.

***Contests.*** Used for actions that directly conflict with an opposing action. An opposed action check rolled by the gamemaster provides the target number for the action check.

> DC = An Opposed Check rolled by the gamemaster.

***Proficiency.*** Used for actions involving an `ability, skill, device, or tool proficiency`. A level of difficulty assigned by the gamemaster provides the target number for the action check.

> DC = A Difficulty Class assigned by the gamemaster.

#### Assigning DC

For unopposed action checks, the gamemaster shall assign a level of difficulty based on the table below.

:: Table - Difficulty Classes

|        Difficulty: | Controlled | Challenging | Risky | Desperate |
| -----------------: | :--------: | :---------: | :---: | :-------: |
| **Target Number**: |     5      |     10      |  15   |    20+    |

#### DC Modifiers

Once the initial target number has been determined, the gamemaster may adjust the DC, `-5 thru +5`, based on any significant factors the GM determines are appropriate to the situation. Thus, the complete range of DC target numbers is `0 thru 25`; a DC cannot be any lower or higher.

<!--Add list of DC Modifiers-->

Remember that the gamemaster only modifies the DC, not the character's action checks. Players need only deal with bonus points to the action check, never penalty points, as those are applied to the DC instead.

***Mundane Actions.*** If a target number reaches `DC 0`, the action becomes mundane. The gamemaster will make the final determination but, in most cases, will wave the action check entirely as a roll is not necessary to complete the action. 

However, mundane actions are only considered PER 1; to improve the performance rating of a mundane action, a character may Play the Odds vs. DC 2; `Critical Failure` occurs on a Natural 1 due to some apparent oversight on the part of the character. Otherwise, the action's performance is calculated normally.

***Improbable Actions.*** If a target number reaches `DC 25`, the action becomes improbable. The gamemaster will make the final determination but, in most cases, will wave the action check entirely as the action cannot be attained by *mortal* characters. However, an *immortal* character may still roll an improbable action check (see `Immortality` for more information).

#### Check Modifiers

Once an action has been determined, a player adjusts the check based on the following factors.

***Ability Score Modifiers.*** <!--add copy here-->

## Resource-Die

Used for resource management and situations where a step-die mechanic can be utilized. This system could replace counting ammo, effort, fatigue, healing, rations, torches, lantern oil, and certain kinds of damage like fire, holy water, and poison. The step-mechanics follow a dice-chain up or down: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. So, starting at the appropriate end of the chain, when a 1-2 is rolled, you step up or down to the next die. When you reach the opposite end of the chain, the resource is spent.
