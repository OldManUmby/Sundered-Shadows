## Actions

<!--Add Types of Actions here -->

Anytime a character is challenged, attempts something new, or the outcome is in question, and a degree of success or failure must be ascertained, the gamemaster will request an Action Check. This check is rolled by the player and will be compared against a Difficulty Class to determine the action's performance.

### Action Check

*Roll 1d20 + proficiency +/- modifiers versus the Difficulty Class (DC).*

***Advantage.*** A character with an obvious situational advantage gains an extra d20 for the action check, of the two dice, the *highest* rolled die is used for the outcome; the *lower* rolled die is discarded. The `rules and the GM` will determine when an disadvanatge exists.

***Disadvantage.*** A character with an obvious situational disadvantage gains an extra d20 for the action check, of the two dice, the *lowest* rolled die is used for the outcome; the *higher* rolled die is discarded. The `rules and the GM` will determine when an disadvanatge exists.

***Success or Failure.*** If the roll reaches or exceeds the DC, the check is successful; otherwise, it fails.

### Difficulty Class

The gamemaster determines the Difficulty Class (DC) for all actions starting with the question, "Is the action opposed or unopposed?"

***Action is Opposed.*** Refers to actions that are in direct conflict with another character's action. For example, a character attacks while an opposed character defends, or a character hides while an opposed character searches.

*DC = The opponent's Armor Class (AC) or an opposed `Skill Check (SC)` rolled by the GM.*

***Action is Unopposed.*** Refers to actions that do not directly conflict with another character but rather the action's own inherent difficulties. For example, a character is attempting to fix a broken wagon wheel or trying to lift a heavy object; there is no opposed character involved, just a level of difficulty.

*DC = The Difficulty is assigned by the GM starting with the Difficulting Class table below.*

#### Assigning The DC

| Difficulty | Easy | Moderate | Hard | Extreme |
| :--------: | :--: | :------: | :--: | :-----: |
|   **DC**   |  5   |    10    |  15  |   20+   |

***DC Modifiers.*** The Difficulty Class table is only a starting point, from here, the gamemaster adjusts the DC, `-5 thru +5`, based on any significant factors the GM determines are appropriate to the situation. Thus, the complete DC range is `0 thru 25`; a DC cannot be any lower or higher.

***Mundane Actions.*** A `DC 0` is considered a mundane action for any character. In such cases, the gamemaster may wave the action check entirely as it is considered an automatic success. However, any character may still play the odds.

> ***Play the Odds.*** If a character (or the GM) still wishes to determine the performance of a mundane action, an action check can be made, but doing so returns the action to a *non-mundane* status of DC 2. Thus, if the check rolls a 1, a `Critical Failure` occurs due to some obvious oversight on the part of the character. Otherwise, the action's performance is calculated normally.

***Impossible Actions.*** A `DC 25` is considered an impossible action for `mortal characters`. In such cases, the gamemaster will wave the action check entirely as it is considered an automatic failure. `However, an immortal character may roll an impossible action check.`

### Performance Rating

When an action succeeds, performance is calculated. Subtract the required DC of the action from the outcome of the rolled check; the result is the Performance Rating (PR) of the action. For example, an action check rolling an 18 against a DC 15 yields a PR 3 (18-15=3). Performance is significant as it determines the finality of the action.

### Initiative

When things get dicey, each character and opponent gets a turn. One player rolls 1d6 for their side versus a roll by the gamemaster. Each side modifies its die with the `lowest Combat Proficiency` of those entering initiative.

`In a one-on-one conflict, both participants may also add their Dexterity bonuses. In such situations - versus non-reach weapons - Reach weapons gain advantage on the initiative roll.`

The side with the highest roll gets to declare their actions first and chooses the order of character actions as needed; this simulates the characters working together in combat.
