## Actions

<!--Add Types of Actions here -->

Anytime a character is challenged, attempts something new, or the outcome is in question, and a degree of success or failure must be ascertained, the gamemaster will request an Action Check. This check is rolled by the player and will be compared against a Difficulty Class to resolve the outcome.

### Difficulty Class

The gamemaster determines the Difficulty Class (DC) for unopposed actions, starting with the DC table below. The DC may fall or rise per the gamemaster's keen understanding of the situation.

| Difficulty | Easy | Moderate | Difficult | Extreme |
| :--------: | :--: | :------: | :-------: | :-----: |
|   **DC**   |  5   |    10    |    15     |   20    |

### Action Check

Roll 1d20 + proficiency +/- modifiers versus the Difficulty Class (DC).

***Action is Opposed.*** DC = The opponent's Armor Class (AC) or an opposed `Skill Check (SC)` rolled by the GM.

***Action is Unopposed.*** DC = The Difficulty assigned by the GM, -4 thru +4, based upon any additional modifiers the gamemaster determines.

***Success or Failure.*** If the roll reaches or exceeds the DC, the check is successful, else it fails.

### Initiative

When things get dicey, each character and opponent gets a turn. One player rolls 1d6 for their side versus a roll by the gamemaster. Each side modifies its die with the `lowest Combat Proficiency` of those entering initiative.

`In a one-on-one conflict, both participants may also add their Dexterity bonuses. In such situations - versus non-reach weapons - Reach weapons gain advantage on the initiative roll.`

The side with the highest roll gets to declare their actions first and chooses the order of character actions as needed; this simulates the characters working together in combat. The gamemaster will request an Action Check if a particular action requires resolution.
