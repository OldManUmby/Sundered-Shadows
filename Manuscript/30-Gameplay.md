## Initiative

When things get dicey, each character and opponent gets a turn. One player rolls 1d6 for their side versus a roll by the gamemaster. Each side modifies its die with the `lowest Combat Proficiency` of those entering initiative.

`In a one-on-one conflict, both participants may also add their Dexterity bonuses. In such situations - versus non-reach weapons - Reach weapons gain advantage on the initiative roll.`

The side with the highest roll gets to declare their actions first and chooses the order of character actions as needed; this simulates the characters working together in combat. The gamemaster will request an Action Check if a particular action requires resolution.

### Action Check

Anytime a character is challenged, attempts something new or demanding, or the outcome is in question, and a degree of success or failure must be ascertained, the gamemaster will request an Action Check to resolve the outcome.

Roll 1d20 + proficiency + any appropriate modifiers. This roll is then compared against a Difficulty Class (DC) assigned by the Gamemaster. If the roll reaches or exceeds the DC, the check is successful, else it fails.
