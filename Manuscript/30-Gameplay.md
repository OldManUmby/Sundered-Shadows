## Turns

The gamemaster will make this determination, but generally, when things get dicey and the order of actions becomes relevant, everyone involved will each get a turn to take their actions. In such cases, initiative may be declared by the gamemaster. Combat is the most common use of initiative.

Turns are divided into the following.

| Units of Time    | Duration     | Common Usage |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Moment of time   | 1-10 seconds | Initiative   |
| Interval of time | 1-10 minutes | Exploration  |
| Period of time   | 1-10 hours   | Recovery     |
| Downtime         | 1-10 days    | Training     |

### Initiative

Once initiative is declared, one player rolls 1d6 for the PC's side versus a roll by the gamemaster for the NPC's side; each modifies its die with the `lowest Proficiency` from its side.

In one-on-one conflicts, each participant will adjust their initiative roll with their DEX Modifier. `Also, reach-weapons gain advantage on initiative versus non-reach-weapons.`

The side with the highest roll gets to declare their actions first and may choose the order of actions from among their side as warranted; this simulates the party's capacity to work together.

## Actions

Typically, most character actions do not require dice rolls; these are non-combat actions considered mundane. However, anytime a character is challenged, attacks, attempts something new, `performs a feat`, casts a spell, or the outcome of an action is in question, and a degree of success or failure must be ascertained, the gamemaster will request an action check.

Action checks are generally not considered solitary actions. More often, action checks are a series of short, quick maneuvers, combined actions, actions performed under stress or requiring extreme exertion, or complex tasks where a degree of concentration or planning is needed. For example, swordplay requires a character to perform many side-to-side movements, dodging, feints, jabbing, parrying, and more just to land that one strike that truly makes a difference in the fight and all that takes place in a single character's action turn.

### Action Types

***Standard.*** Action checks like attacking, defending, maneuvering, spellcasting, and using `abilities, skills, and devices`.
***Bonus.*** Extra action checks gained for reasons of momentum or special circumstances.
***Extended.*** Tasks requiring more than one action check to perform.
***Group.*** An assisted action check performed by multiple characters.
***Save.*** A reaction check involving a character's natural ability and experience.

### Action Checks

*Roll 1d20 + Proficiency + Modifiers vs. DC*

***Advantage (ADV).*** A character with a situational advantage gains an extra d20 for the action check, of the two dice, the *highest* rolled die is used for the outcome; the *lower* rolled die is discarded. The rules and the GM will determine when an advantage exists.

***Disadvantage (DIS).*** A character with a situational disadvantage gains an extra d20 for the action check, of the two dice, the *lowest* rolled die is used for the outcome; the *higher* rolled die is discarded. The rules and the GM will determine when a disadvantage exists.

***Effectiveness (EFF).*** If the roll reaches or exceeds the DC, the check is successful; otherwise, it has failed. If successful, performance is calculated.

- ***Natural 1.*** During an action check, especially an attack action, when the d20 rolls an unmodified 1, such an action is considered a `critical failure`.<!--More critical required-->
- ***Natural 20.*** During an action check, especially an attack action, when the d20 rolls an unmodified 20, such an action is considered a `critical success`.<!--More critical required-->

***Performance (PER).*** Subtract the required DC of the action from the outcome of the rolled check; the difference is the action's performance.

#### Defense/Difficulty Class (DC)

Defence Class (a.k.a. Defense) and Difficulty Class (a.k.a. Difficulty) are synonymous; both provide the required target number for all action checks. Determining DC, however, starts by asking, "Is the action opposed or unopposed?"

***Opposed Action Checks.*** Refers to actions that directly conflict with an opposing character's action, like a contest. For example, a character attacks while an opposed character defends; thus, the target number for the action check is provided by the defense class of the opponent. In another example, a character hides while an opposed character searches; thus, the target number for the action check is provided by an opposed check rolled by the gamemaster. These two examples best represent opposed DC.

> DC = Defense Class or an Opposed Action Check rolled by the gamemaster.

***Unopposed Action Checks.*** Refers to actions that do not directly conflict with another character but rather the action's inherent difficulties. For example, a character is attempting to fix a broken wagon wheel or lift a heavy object; although these actions are challenging, there is no defense class or opposed action check involved, simply a level of difficulty assigned by the gamemaster.

> DC = Difficulty Class assigned by the gamemaster.

#### Assigning DC

For unopposed action checks, the gamemaster shall assign a level of difficulty based on the table below.

:: Table - Difficulty Classes

|        Difficulty: | Controlled | Challenging | Risky | Desperate |
| -----------------: | :--------: | :---------: | :---: | :-------: |
| **TARGET NUMBER**: |     5      |     10      |  15   |    20+    |

#### DC Modifiers

Once the initial target number has been determined, the gamemaster may adjust the DC, `-5 thru +5`, based on any significant factors the GM determines are appropriate to the situation. Thus, the complete range of DC target numbers is `0 thru 25`; a DC cannot be any lower or higher.

Remember that the gamemaster only modifies the DC, not the character's action checks. Players need only deal with bonus points to the action check, never penalty points, as those are applied to the DC instead.

***Mundane Actions.*** If a target number reaches `DC 0`, the action becomes mundane. The gamemaster will make the final determination but, in most cases, will wave the action check entirely as a roll is not necessary to complete the action. 

However, mundane actions are only considered PER 1; to improve the performance rating of a mundane action, a character may Play the Odds vs. DC 2; `Critical Failure` occurs on a Natural 1 due to some apparent oversight on the part of the character. Otherwise, the action's performance is calculated normally.

***Improbable Actions.*** If a target number reaches `DC 25`, the action becomes improbable. The gamemaster will make the final determination but, in most cases, will wave the action check entirely as the action cannot be attained by *mortal* characters. However, an *immortal* character may still roll an improbable action check (see `Immortality` for more information).

#### Check Modifiers

Once an action has been determined, a player adjusts the check based on the following factors.

## Resource-Die

Used for resource management and situations where step-die mechanics can be utilized. This system could replace counting ammo, effort, fatigue, healing, rations, torches, lantern oil, and certain kinds of damage like fire, holy water, and poison. The step-mechanics follow this dice chain up or down: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. So, starting at the appropriate end of the chain, when a 1-2 is rolled, you step up or down to the next die. When you reach the opposite end of the chain, the resource is spent.
