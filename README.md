# The Sundered Shadows Roleplaying Game

***A Minimal OSR Adventure Ruleset. Fast action. More story. Less rules.***

Sundered Shadows (SSRPG) is a rules-lite d20-based old-school renaissance (OSR) tabletop roleplaying game designed for cinematic storytelling, high danger, and quick action flow, yet allows for a sundry of character features, gear, and optional rules. With some minor adjustment, Sundered Shadows is compatible with other OSR-styled fantasy games and materials.

***Will there be an SRD?*** Yes. *Sundered Shadows RPG* contains guidelines for publishing content under a `yet-to-be-determined` game license.
